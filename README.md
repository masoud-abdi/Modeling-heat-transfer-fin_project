# heat-transfer-fin_project
This is a project of heat transfer that include analytic method and numerical method. in this project I solve the equation of heat transfer from kind of fins. 
In this project, the heat transfer around the blades was solved using numerical methods.
Finally, the optimal length for each fin was obtained, and you can see the results in the PDF file.
If you have any questions, we will be in touch by my email (masoud abdi 789@gmail.com).
